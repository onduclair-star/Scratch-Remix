# Scratch-Remix

Tired of original Scratch? Not enough blocks? Laggy FPS? Debugging feels mind-numbingly boring?

Say hello to **Scratch-Remix** — a free, open-source Scratch remake built entirely in Unity by a solo developer!

---

## Features

### Enhanced Block System
- New powerful blocks: e.g., `Time.deltaTime` for buttery-smooth animations. More control, events, and operators on the way!
- Custom blocks supported: Not happy with what's there? Submit ideas or add your own!
- [WIP] Optimized block interpreter with full support for complex logic (if/else, loops, nested conditions, etc.).

### Modern & Smooth UI
- Silky drag-and-drop experience + smart auto-hiding toolbar — feels modern but stays kid-friendly.
- [WIP] Built-in sprite editor: drag sprites, create multi-frame animations (actively in development).

### Blazing Performance
- Powered by Unity 2D, targeting rock-solid 60 FPS even on low-end hardware.
- Post-MVP: Release a Unity package version — let the full Unity engine handle the heavy lifting!

## Highlights
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux best experience; WebGL excluded for now).
- 100% free and open-source — modify and share freely for non-commercial use!
- GitHub: https://github.com/onduclair-star/Scratch-Remix  
  ⭐ A star keeps the project alive (and makes my day)!

---

## Roadmap
- **Short-term**: Polish core features so you can easily build small games and animations.
- **Long-term**: Implement a static interpreter for better performance on large projects.
