# Scratch-Remix

Tired of the *original Scratch*?  
**Not enough blocks?** **FPS too low?** Debugging *too straightforward*?

Then you've just found your perfect match. :)

## Features

### Blocks
There are lots of extra blocks (for example: `Time.deltaTime` will be added). And if you're still not satisfied with the default blocks, you can give feedback or even create your own custom blocks.

### User-Friendly Experience
Scratch-Remix includes modern UI interactions and animations — such as the auto-delay toolbar — to make the editor feel smoother, cleaner, and closer to modern software standards, while still staying simple and easy to use.

---

## Characteristics
- Runs on all mainstream operating systems, with desktop platforms having the best support.
- This is an open-source project. Anyone can view or edit the scripts for non-commercial purposes.

---

## Roadmap
- Future plan: a traditional static interpreter for better performance in extremely large projects. (This will take time, and is not a priority before full feature completion.)

## License
Non-commercial use only. You may read or modify the scripts, but commercial usage is not permitted.
